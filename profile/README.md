## Hiya, we're Stack64! <img src="https://github.com/Stack64MC/.github/blob/main/profile/Stack64Logo-Rev1.png?raw=true" data-canonical-src="https://github.com/Stack64MC/.github/blob/main/profile/Stack64Logo-Rev1.png?raw=true" width="40" height="40" />

Stack64 is a project that aims to create an easy-to-use stack for Minecraft Spigot servers that want Bedrock Console cross-play.

We're currently closed-source, but we may open-source in the future when all projects are in a usable state.
